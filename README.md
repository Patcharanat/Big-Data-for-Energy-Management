# EE-Project: Big Data for Energy Management
*By Patcharanat P.*

## Introduction
---
Chulalongkorn University is an educational institute that consumes enormous energy power referring to the [CUBEMS website](https://www.bems.chula.ac.th/web/cham5/#/) monitoring building energy consumption. Hence, it seems to be utilizable and applicable if we are able to implement the data collected from the [CUBEMS project](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-020-00582-3) with Machine Learning and Data Improvement to initiate an idea of energy management and future research to optimize energy costs for Chulalongkorn University. Understanding the energy need could be a step further in planning the resources therefore, it became the main idea of this project to be created.

In this project, the author emphasized machine learning model development, result evaluation, and data Improvement using the [CUBEMS dataset](https://github.com/Patcharanat/Big-Data-for-Energy-Management/tree/master/dataset), which recorded the Charmchuri 5 buildingâ€™s energy consumption and characteristic of the environment. Most of the important works are written and some which are less relevant are only mentioned but not written in detail to give an idea for future works or further research.
